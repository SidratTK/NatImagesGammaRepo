% showR2All performs separability analysis - Figs 1,2
% getGammaParamters obtains model paramters from parametric data. Figs 3,4
% getPredictedGamma has the obtained model paramters and can be directly
% used to predict gamma given a set of features (of grating or hue patch)
% getTypicalElecFig can be used to show image patches and approximations of
% a typical electrode, and the gamma response estimates of that electrode. Fig5
% getCorrelationFig uses all protocols and electrodes to get correlation
% between actual and estimated gamma of both monkeys.
